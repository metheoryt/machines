# Windows Clean Reinstall — Runbook

Generated 2026-07-05. Machine: single 2 TB NVMe (disk 0), currently C: (976 GB Windows) + 884 GB Linux dual-boot (to be removed).

**End state:** one Windows 11 install on the full 2 TB disk, Linux dual-boot gone, WSL for Linux work.

**Backup target:** Kingston XS2000 1 TB USB SSD → **`R:` (partition "data", Disk 1)**, ~700 GB free. Backup lives in `R:\backup`; automated by `backup.ps1`. Note: on the freshly reinstalled Windows the SSD **usually gets a different drive letter** — it came back as **`H:`** after the 2026-07 reinstall, and this is expected. You don't hand-substitute: **`restore.ps1` and `bootstrap-agents.ps1` auto-discover the backup on *any* drive letter** (they scan every volume for `<L>:\backup`). The literal `R:\backup` paths in the Phase 4 steps below are illustrative — only substitute the real letter if you run a raw manual copy instead of the scripts.

**Where this runbook + script live:** in the **`machines` repo** at `hosts/g16/windows/` (this machine is `g16`). They're committed and pushed to `github.com/metheoryt/machines`, so they survive the wipe — after reinstall, `git clone` machines to get them back (no dependency on the broken OneDrive). Each backup run also drops standalone copies on the SSD: `R:\backup\windows-reinstall-runbook.md` and `R:\windows-reinstall\backup.ps1`. Run the script from the repo: `cd <your machines checkout>\hosts\g16\windows`.

---

## ⛔ THE ONE RULE

**Preserve → VERIFY the backup opens → only THEN wipe.**
Do not delete a single partition until Phase 2 passes. A copy command exiting `0` is not proof; opening the file is.

---

## Phase 0 — Inventory (non-destructive)

Run in **PowerShell**. Write outputs to the SSD.

```powershell
mkdir R:\backup\inventory -Force
winget export -o R:\backup\inventory\winget-packages-snapshot.json # point-in-time snapshot for DIFFING (restore uses the curated repo file, not this)
winget list > R:\backup\inventory\winget-list-full.txt              # readable list of EVERYTHING (incl. Steam/ARP/Store apps winget can't reinstall)
# WSL apt package list (also captured inside the export, this is a readable copy). The script
# does this per distro (suffixed with the distro name); one distro shown here for reference.
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -c "dpkg --get-selections" > R:\backup\inventory\wsl-apt-selections-Ubuntu-24.04.txt
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -c "pipx list --short 2>/dev/null; uv tool list 2>/dev/null; npm -g ls --depth=0 2>/dev/null" > R:\backup\inventory\wsl-global-tools-Ubuntu-24.04.txt
```

**⚠️ OneDrive + Google Drive sync is unreliable on this machine — do NOT treat the cloud as a backup.** We copy their local folders to the SSD directly (step 1e). Both are fully present on disk (no online-only stubs), so a copy captures real content.
- [ ] Optional: open the OneDrive and Google Drive **web UIs** and glance for anything that exists only in the cloud (created on another device, never pulled down) — copy those down before wiping, since they're not on this machine to back up.
- [ ] Chrome: `chrome://settings/syncSetup` shows sync ON (restores bookmarks/passwords/extensions after reinstall)
- [ ] JetBrains: Settings Sync enabled (Settings → Settings Sync)

---

## Phase 1 — Preserve

> **All of Phase 1 is automated by `backup.ps1`** (in this folder: `machines/hosts/g16/windows/`). Run it from an elevated PowerShell — `cd <your machines checkout>\hosts\g16\windows`, then `.\backup.ps1 -WhatIf` first, then `.\backup.ps1`. The steps below document what it does and why. Backup target is `R:\backup` (the Kingston USB SSD, Disk 1 — survives the wipe; the script hard-stops if pointed at Disk 0).

### 1a. Git repos — full copy, no push

Windows repos (`C:\Users\methe\GitHub`) are copied **in full including `.git`** — so stashes, uncommitted, and unpushed commits are all preserved — minus `.venv`/`node_modules`/caches. **Nothing is pushed.** Current repos: **airdrome, nix, qaz-law, vasya** (the rest moved to WSL). WSL-side repos are captured wholesale by the WSL export (1b), so they need no separate handling.

### 1b. WSL — full export (no slim)

With ~700 GB free on the SSD there's no need to slim first — export each distro as-is (non-destructive, live env untouched). The script **auto-discovers every installed distro except the `docker-desktop*` plumbing** and exports each to `R:\backup\wsl\<distro>.tar` (e.g. `Ubuntu-24.04.tar`). **Delete the distros you don't want BEFORE running** (`wsl --unregister <name>`) — whatever remains is exported. Manual equivalent for one distro:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
wsl --export Ubuntu-24.04 R:\backup\wsl\Ubuntu-24.04.tar
```

Each archive = that distro's projects, `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg` (GPG keys), `.kube`, dotfiles, apt state. `docker-desktop` (and `docker-desktop-data`) are always skipped — nothing to save there.

### 1c. qaz-law database — NOT backed up (recreatable)

The 100 GB qaz-law Postgres volume is **dropped**: the data can be re-ingested after reinstall, so there's no backup. After the fresh install, bring the stack up (empty DB) and re-run your ingestion. This removes the single largest and slowest backup item.

### 1d. Windows configs & creds → `R:\backup\home`

**Inclusive sweep with a blocklist:** every dotfile/dotdir in the profile is copied (`.ssh` incl. `config`+`known_hosts`, `.claude.json`, `.config`, `.kube`, `.gcm`, `.agents`, `.claude`, `.codex`, shell histories, etc.), so no config is missed — minus `node_modules`/`.venv` inside them. Plus loose `AGENTS.md`. (Repos → 1a; WSL secrets → 1f.)

> **Agent config symlinks:** `.claude`/`.codex` contain symlinks into the **`machines` repo** (`agents/…`: `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `memory/*`, `hooks/*`, `skills/*`, `cyphy` plugin). Those are the source of truth and are backed up via the machines repo in 1a — the sweep uses `/XJ` so it does **not** duplicate them. The backup keeps only the **machine-local** real files in `.claude`/`.codex` (`.credentials.json`, `settings.local.json`, `projects/` history). See Phase 4.2 for the restore order.

**Excluded** (recreatable caches, dropped apps, or explicitly not wanted): `.cache`, `.lmstudio`, `.vscode`, `.codeium`, `.windsurf`, `.zcode`, `.zed_server`, `.openclaude`(+`.json`), `.marvin`, `.junie`, `.gortex`, `.boto`, `.gsutil`, `.gemini`, `.k8slens`, `.docker` (Docker Desktop rebuilds it; re-`docker login` for registries).

### 1e. User data + cloud folders (sync is unreliable — backed up directly)

Copied to `R:\backup`: **Downloads**; **OneDrive** — ⚠️ **sync is broken on this PC, so the cloud is NOT trusted**; the script copies the local `C:\Users\methe\OneDrive` folder **directly** (incl. your redirected **Documents**, **Pictures**, and **Desktop** = `OneDrive\Рабочий стол`). Currently **all 13,527 files / 3.6 GB are fully on disk, 0 online-only stubs**, so the direct copy is complete. The step re-checks for stubs at backup time and, if any appear (a broken engine may dehydrate files), writes `R:\backup\OneDrive-STUBS-NOT-ON-DISK.csv` and warns — those must be pulled from onedrive.live.com before wiping. Also: **GoogleDrive**; **Obsidian** vault(s) (path read from `%APPDATA%\obsidian\obsidian.json`); and **RustDesk config** (`%APPDATA%\RustDesk\config` → `R:\backup\home\AppData\RustDesk\config` — your RustDesk ID, private key/device identity, saved peers, and relay/ID-server settings; the noisy `log\` folder is skipped). The script also drops a copy of this runbook onto the SSD.
> Keep the runbook readable while the PC is down — it's pushed to `github.com/metheoryt/machines` (`hosts/g16/windows/`), so you can open it there from your phone or any device. The SSD also has a copy at `R:\backup\windows-reinstall-runbook.md`. (Do **not** rely on the broken OneDrive to deliver it.)

**App configs** (`AppData`, not caught by the profile-root dotfile sweep) → `R:\backup\home\AppData\…`:
- **Windows Terminal** `settings.json` (profiles, color schemes, keybinds)
- **PowerToys** settings (FancyZones layouts, keyboard remaps, EnvironmentVariables, ColorPicker) — `Updates` payload skipped
- **NCALayer** — the `.der` cert + settings (kept app); bundled `jre`/caches skipped
- **AIMP** — playlists (`PLS`), library, custom genres/moods, skins, `AIMP.ini` (the music *curation*; the files themselves are on methe-server)
- **Telegram Desktop `tdata`** — so **AyuGram** can import your session/drafts on the fresh install

**System settings:** **Wi-Fi profiles** with cleartext passwords → `R:\backup\secrets\wifi\*.xml` (via `netsh wlan export`, so they ride the mandatory off-SSD second copy); **user environment variables** (incl. custom `PATH`) → `R:\backup\inventory\hkcu-environment.reg`.

**Dropped on purpose (no backup):** Music (already on methe-server), torrents, all Docker images + all Docker volumes (incl. qaz-law DB — re-ingest after reinstall), caches, `.venv`/`node_modules` in repos.

### 1f. Second copy of the irreplaceable secrets  ⭐ (do NOT skip — the SSD is a single point of failure)

Your GPG keys live inside the WSL export on one SSD. If that SSD is dead when you plug it back in, GPG keys are **gone forever** (unlike SSH, they can't be regenerated — you'd lose the ability to decrypt anything old). So the script also extracts the tiny secret set as loose files to **`R:\backup\secrets\`** (WSL `.ssh`/`.gnupg`/`.gitconfig` via `\\wsl.localhost`, plus Windows SSH keys) — independently restorable without unpacking the big tar.

**Your manual job (the script won't do this):** copy `R:\backup\secrets\` to a **second location independent of the SSD** — methe-server (`scp`/`rsync`), a password-manager attachment, or an encrypted archive emailed to yourself. Two independent copies of the few MB that can't be re-derived.
- [ ] Second copy of `secrets/` confirmed on methe-server (or other independent location)

---

## Phase 2 — VERIFY  ✅ (gate — do not proceed until every box is checked)

- [ ] `R:\backup\repos\` has all 4 repos (airdrome, nix, qaz-law, vasya), each with a `.git` folder inside (confirms stashes/uncommitted came along)
- [ ] Open 2–3 files **directly from `R:\`** — a repo file, the Obsidian vault, a Download — they actually open
- [ ] `R:\backup\wsl\*.tar` — one tar per distro you kept (e.g. `Ubuntu-24.04.tar`), each a non-trivial size (full export, not 0); the main Ubuntu is ~25–31 GB. No `docker-desktop*.tar`.
- [ ] `R:\backup\secrets\` has a **second copy** off the SSD (see 1f) — the one thing whose loss is unrecoverable
- [ ] `R:\backup\inventory\winget-packages-snapshot.json` is present and non-empty (restore uses the curated repo file; this is the diff snapshot)
- [ ] `.ssh` keys (id_ed25519, id_rsa) present under `R:\backup\home\.ssh`
- [ ] `R:\backup\OneDrive` and `R:\backup\GoogleDrive` copied — open a file from each on the SSD to confirm real content (not 0-byte). OneDrive folder includes your Documents + Pictures + **Desktop** (`Рабочий стол`) — confirm the Desktop subfolder is there.
- [ ] **OneDrive sync is broken** → confirm **no** `R:\backup\OneDrive-STUBS-NOT-ON-DISK.csv` was created (its presence means some files were online-only and got missed — recover them from onedrive.live.com first). Ideally also spot-check the SSD's OneDrive file count ≈ 13,527.
- [ ] **This runbook is readable from a device other than this PC** — confirm it's on `github.com/metheoryt/machines` (`hosts/g16/windows/`, pushed) AND at `R:\backup\windows-reinstall-runbook.md` on the SSD (don't trust OneDrive to deliver it)

**Belt-and-suspenders:** optionally `rsync`/copy the whole `R:\backup` folder to methe-server too. Costs little, means the network *and* the SSD would both have to fail to lose anything.

---

## Phase 3 — Wipe & install  🔥 (point of no return)

**Installer media = the Kingston SSD itself (Ventoy).** The one USB SSD is dual-purpose: **P: ("Boot")** is the Ventoy boot partition (ISOs + config + drivers), **R: ("data")** is the backup. So you **cannot unplug it during install** — you're booting from it. The old "unplug the SSD" safety is replaced by **disk-screen discipline: only ever touch Disk 0.**

1. **VERIFY the backup on R: first (Phase 2).** The same drive is your installer, so it stays connected through the install — all the more reason the backup must be confirmed good before you delete anything.
2. Boot from the Kingston: power on → spam the ASUS boot menu key (F8 / Esc) → pick the Ventoy entry.
3. In Ventoy, select **`Win11_25H2_Russian_x64_v2.iso`**. Ventoy's Auto Install plugin offers `/unattend/autounattend.xml` (see box) — accept it.
4. If the disk screen shows **no drives** (g16 ships with **Intel VMD/RST on**): **Load driver** → browse to **`P:\rsti\`** (`iaStorVD.inf`) → the NVMe appears.
5. On the disk screen, act **only on Disk 0 — the 2 TB internal NVMe** (SHPP41-2000GM): **delete ALL its partitions** (removes the Linux dual-boot + bootloader, reclaims the 884 GB) until it's one unallocated block. ⚠️ **Do NOT touch Disk 1** (~954 GB "Kingston XS2000", USB) — that's P:/R:, your installer + backup. Tell them apart by size + bus.
6. Select Disk 0's unallocated space → Next. Setup uses the full 2 TB.
7. OOBE: `autounattend.xml` handles locale/debloat/config; you set the account + Wi-Fi interactively.

> **💿 Ventoy (as configured on the Kingston, 2026-07-05).** `P:\ventoy\ventoy.json` uses the Auto Install plugin:
> ```json
> { "auto_install": [ { "image": "/Win11_25H2_Russian_x64_v2.iso", "template": "/unattend/autounattend.xml" } ] }
> ```
> Booting that ISO through Ventoy auto-offers our answer file. **The repo's `autounattend.xml` is source of truth; deploy = copy it to `P:\unattend\autounattend.xml`** after any edit (they must stay in sync). The other ISOs on P: (NixOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, GParted, Acronis) are unaffected — the mapping is Win11-only. `P:\rsti\` = Intel RST/VMD storage drivers for step 4 (recreatable from Intel/ASUS; not in the repo).

> **🔧 `autounattend.xml` (committed at [`./autounattend.xml`](./autounattend.xml)) — automates the *config* side of the install.** Generated by the [schneegans unattend-generator](https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/); the exact config URL is embedded as a comment at the top of the file, so it's regenerable. **Usage:** copy it to the **root of the Windows 11 install USB** as `autounattend.xml` (exact name) — Setup auto-detects it. **Verified 2026-07-05:** no secrets (product key is the public generic Win11-Pro edition selector; account + Wi-Fi are interactive), and **no `<DiskConfiguration>`** → the disk-selection screen still appears, so the manual SSD-unplugged, post-VERIFY wipe gate (THE ONE RULE) is preserved.
> - **Does:** TPM/SecureBoot/RAM bypass, debloat (Copilot/Recall/Teams/OneNote/etc.), locale RU-UI + EN/KZ keyboards, privacy/telemetry off, long paths, RDP, Explorer tweaks.
> - **Restore is a SEPARATE manual step:** `FirstLogon.ps1` only cleans up — it does *not* auto-run restore. After first login, run the one-liner yourself (`irm …/install.ps1 | iex`, Phase 4.0). Keeps the file regenerable and avoids an unattended restore touching secrets.
> - **Still VM-test** (Hyper-V) before trusting it on real hardware — not hardware-tested yet.
> - **winget:** app installs go via restore's `winget import`, never inline in the installer (App Installer often isn't provisioned yet on a fresh image).

---

## Phase 4 — Restore

> ### 🔤 Phase 4.0 — Rename this repo `nix` → `machines` (do this FIRST, before re-cloning)
> This repo outgrew the `nix` name — it holds every host's config (NixOS modules *and* Windows `hosts/g16`), the agent environment, memory, and bootstrap. Rename it now, while re-cloning is unavoidable anyway (so there's no local `git mv` to do — just clone under the new name).
> 1. On GitHub: repo **Settings → Rename** `nix` → `machines`. **(done 2026-07-05.)** GitHub keeps redirects, so any lingering `…/nix` reference below still resolves until you've swept them.
> 2. Clone under the new name: `git clone git@github.com:metheoryt/machines.git C:\Users\<you>\GitHub\machines` — use `machines` everywhere the steps below say `nix`. **(The one-liner below does this for you.)**
> 3. Sweep the hard-coded `nix` references (then commit + push). **(done 2026-07-06.)** The active path/URL refs in `backup.ps1`, `modules\system\git-autofetch\git-autofetch.ps1`, `install.ps1`, and this runbook now say `machines`. The **restore-side scripts** (`restore.ps1`, `bootstrap-agents.ps1`, `git-autofetch.ps1`) now derive the repo root from their **own location** (`$PSScriptRoot`) instead of assuming `~\GitHub\machines`, so the checkout can live anywhere (this box keeps it at `~\machines`). `agents/memory/global.md`, `flake.nix` / `modules/**`, `.gortex.yaml` / `.mcp.json`, and the `just agent-bootstrap*` recipes were already clean. Only historical mentions remain and are intentionally left: the `repos\nix\` backup-folder name (correct as of the pre-rename backup) and the `docs/superpowers/plans/**` `cd …/GitHub/nix` lines (history, low priority).
> 4. On the *other* machine(s): `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:metheoryt/machines.git` and rename the local clone dir to match. **On NixOS, then repoint `~/nix` at the renamed clone** — `ln -sfn ~/gh/machines ~/nix` — because `modules/home/claude.nix` / `codex.nix` read `~/nix/agents`; leaving `~/nix` dangling makes the next `home-manager` activation write broken symlinks (and the fish `~/nix` helpers break too). `just switch` now hard-fails with a repoint hint if you skip this.
>
> **▶ Automated entry point (does step 2 + the restore below).** On the fresh Windows, from an **elevated** PowerShell:
> ```powershell
> irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metheoryt/machines/main/hosts/g16/windows/install.ps1 | iex
> ```
> Installs git if missing, clones `machines`, and runs `restore.ps1` — which **discovers the backup on the SSD, lets you pick one, and prints the plan (dry run; writes nothing)**. Re-run `hosts\g16\windows\restore.ps1 -Go` to apply the **automatic** items (repos, dotfiles, `.ssh`+perms, Downloads, Obsidian, cloud→`*-from-backup`), and `-Go -Force` to also overwrite a non-empty `.ssh`/repo. The numbered steps 1–9 below are exactly what it automates or prints as **guided** commands (winget, agent bootstrap, WSL import, app configs, cloud reconcile). The reference sweep (step 3 above) stays manual.

1. **Windows apps:** the curated keeper list is version-controlled in the repo at `hosts\g16\windows\winget-packages.json` (already pruned — dropped apps removed, Store/forgotten apps added), so no manual editing: `winget import --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements --ignore-unavailable hosts\g16\windows\winget-packages.json`. Reinstall the non-winget keepers (JetBrains Toolbox → PyCharm, NCALayer, RustDesk, Intel DSA) by hand. *(The SSD `inventory\winget-packages-snapshot.json` is only a point-in-time capture for diffing new installs back into the curated list — not the restore source.)*
2. **SSH + configs (Windows):** copy `R:\backup\home\.ssh` → `C:\Users\<you>\.ssh`, then fix perms (icacls: remove inherited, grant your user only). Restore the other dotfiles (`.gitconfig`, `.wslconfig`, `.kube`, `.gcm`, `.config`, `.claude.json`, shell histories, etc.).
   - **Agent config (`.claude`/`.codex`) — bootstrap, don't copy verbatim:** run `hosts\g16\windows\bootstrap-agents.ps1 -BackupRoot R:\backup` (add `-Work` if the work profile is used). One script enables **Developer Mode** (native symlinks fail without it — the agent config is all symlinks into this repo), ensures Git + Claude Code, runs `agents/bootstrap.sh` (via Git Bash — the `just agent-bootstrap` recipe and the bare `bash` on PATH both misbehave on Windows), and restores only the machine-local bits (`.credentials.json`, `settings.local.json`, `projects/`) without clobbering the freshly-bootstrapped symlink trees. On NixOS/macOS the equivalent is `just agent-bootstrap`.
   - **Background git-sync (`git-autofetch`) — register the Scheduled Task (⚠️ easy to forget: it was NOT auto-installed after the 2026-07 restore).** The fleet relies on a per-machine timer that fetches every repo's refs every ~10 min, so `git status` / the shell prompt show "behind by N" without anyone fetching first (NixOS gets this from `services.gitAutoFetch`). On Windows it's a Scheduled Task wrapping `modules\system\git-autofetch\git-autofetch.ps1`; register it **once**, from the machines repo root, using the snippet in that script's header `.EXAMPLE` block. It auto-includes this repo's own checkout as a scan root (plus `~\GitHub`), so it works wherever the repo lives. Verify: `Get-ScheduledTask git-autofetch`.
3. **WSL:** install WSL + Ubuntu, then either
   - `wsl --import Ubuntu-24.04 C:\Users\<you>\WSL\Ubuntu-24.04 R:\backup\wsl\Ubuntu-24.04.tar` to restore wholesale (one `--import` per distro tar you kept), **or**
   - fresh Ubuntu + restore only `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, dotfiles from the tar and re-clone repos (cleaner). Rebuild venvs (`uv sync` / `pip install`).
   - **`--import` gotchas (learned the hard way):**
     - **The install-location's *parent* must already exist** — `--import` creates only the leaf folder, so a missing `C:\WSL\` fails with `Wsl/ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND`. Creating a folder at the **root of `C:\` needs admin**; import under the user profile (`C:\Users\<you>\WSL\`) to avoid elevation.
     - **Imported distros boot as `root`** (no default user is carried in the tar). Set it inside the distro so it's portable and survives re-export — append to `/etc/wsl.conf`, then `wsl --terminate <distro>`:
       ```ini
       [user]
       default=me
       ```
     - **Make the VHD sparse so it auto-shrinks and doesn't bloat the SSD:** `wsl --shutdown` first (the whole WSL VM must release the disk — `--terminate <distro>` alone hits `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` while other distros/Docker Desktop hold the VM), then `wsl --manage <distro> --set-sparse true --allow-unsafe`. Verify: the distro's `Flags` under `HKCU\...\Lxss\<guid>` gains the `+8` bit (7 → 15). For *new* distros instead, set `[experimental] sparseVhd=true` in `.wslconfig`.
4. **Windows repos:** copy `R:\backup\repos\*` back to `C:\Users\<you>\GitHub\` — they weren't pushed, so this backup **is** the source of truth for their stashes/uncommitted work. Recreate `.venv`s (`uv sync`). (WSL repos come back inside the WSL import in step 3.)
5. **Docker + qaz-law DB:** install Docker Desktop, `git clone`/restore qaz-law, bring the stack up (empty DB), then **re-run your ingestion** to repopulate. No restore from backup — the DB was intentionally not backed up.
6. **User data:** copy `Downloads` and the Obsidian vault back. **RustDesk:** install it, then **fully stop it** — elevated `Stop-Service RustDesk -Force` + kill the `RustDesk` processes (it runs as a **LocalSystem service** that keeps the config files locked) — copy `R:\backup\home\AppData\RustDesk\config\*` into `%APPDATA%\RustDesk\config\`, then start it. That restores the **address book / saved peers**, but **not** the retranslator: the service rewrites the user config on start, so `RustDesk2.toml`/`RustDesk.toml` don't stick. Re-enter the custom server by hand in **Settings → Network → ID/Relay Server** — ID Server + Relay Server = the `custom-rendezvous-server`/`relay-server` host, plus the `key`, all read from `RustDesk2.toml` (`restore.ps1` prints these ready-to-paste). The GUI propagates it to the service and it holds. The old RustDesk ID is service-managed too — a fresh ID is fine unless you specifically need the old one.
   - **App configs** (install each app first, close it, then drop files back into the matching `%APPDATA%`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%` path):
     - **Windows Terminal:** `…\home\AppData\WindowsTerminal\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\settings.json` → its `…\LocalState\`.
     - **PowerToys:** `…\home\AppData\Local\PowerToys\*` → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerToys\`.
     - **NCALayer / AIMP:** copy back into `%APPDATA%\NCALayer` and `%APPDATA%\AIMP` (reinstall regenerates the `jre`/caches that were skipped).
     - **AyuGram (Telegram):** AyuGram is **portable** — its `tdata` sits **next to `AyuGram.exe`** (the winget package dir), not `%APPDATA%`. To reuse the backup session, **close AyuGram**, replace its `tdata\` **wholesale** with `…\home\AppData\Telegram Desktop\tdata` (two `tdata` folders can't be merged), and relaunch. A winget update can wipe the package-dir tdata. (Or install stock Telegram Desktop and drop the tdata into `%APPDATA%\Telegram Desktop\`.)
   - **Wi-Fi:** if you signed in with the Microsoft account, "sync your settings" usually **restores the profiles already** — a blind `netsh wlan add profile` then fails with *"a profile with this name already exists in group policy or different user scope"*, which is **expected, not an error**. Check what's genuinely missing first (`netsh wlan show profiles`) and only re-add those, per-user: `netsh wlan add profile filename="R:\backup\secrets\wifi\<name>.xml" user=current`. (`restore.ps1` prints the exact missing-only list.)
   - **Env vars:** do **not** `reg import` the whole `R:\backup\inventory\hkcu-environment.reg` — it pins a user `PATH` full of tool dirs that don't exist yet on a fresh install. The user `PATH` rebuilds itself as you reinstall each tool, and `PSModulePath`/`TEMP`/`TMP`/`OneDrive` are set by Windows/installers. Only two entries are truly custom — re-apply just these: `WSLENV=USERPROFILE/up`, and prepend your manual `C:\Users\<you>\.local\bin` to the user `PATH`. Use `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(...,'User')`, **not** `setx` (setx truncates a `PATH` longer than 1024 chars). Keep the `.reg` for reference.
7. **Cloud folders:** **OneDrive was broken — the SSD copy is the source of truth, not the cloud.** After reinstall, set OneDrive up fresh; once it settles, compare its folder against `R:\backup\OneDrive` and copy back anything missing (a broken account may still be missing files in the cloud). If OneDrive stays unreliable, just restore `R:\backup\OneDrive\*` into a plain local folder and stop depending on it. Re-install Google Drive and let it sync, then compare against `R:\backup\GoogleDrive` the same way. In all cases the SSD copy is authoritative.
8. **Sign back in:** Chrome (sync pulls bookmarks/passwords/extensions), JetBrains Settings Sync.
9. Reconnect the SSD only after the fresh OS is trusted; keep the backup until you've confirmed everything restored (including cloud-folder comparison in step 7), then reclaim the space.

**Already safe (not on SSD):** git repos pushed to GitHub · Music on methe-server · Chrome/JetBrains via account sync.
**No longer trusted as safe:** OneDrive (Documents/Pictures) and Google Drive — sync is unreliable, so they're backed up to the SSD above.

## Appendix B — Software inventory (what to reinstall)

Curated from `winget list` + WSL packages on 2026-07-05. **Excluded as auto/noise** (don't reinstall by hand): NVIDIA/Intel/Realtek/Thunderbolt drivers, VC++ redistributables, .NET runtimes, WindowsAppRuntimes, UI.Xaml, codec/video extensions, and built-in Store apps (Photos, Paint, Calculator, Xbox, etc.).

### Restored automatically
- **`winget import` the curated repo list** (`hosts\g16\windows\winget-packages.json`, version-controlled) → all winget keepers below **plus** the four Store apps (WhatsApp, NetSpot, NVIDIA App, MyASUS) via its `msstore` source block. Already pruned, so no pre-edit — just import.
- **Chrome / JetBrains** → account sync (bookmarks, passwords, IDE settings).

### Dev — IDEs & editors
PyCharm (via **JetBrains Toolbox** — install Toolbox first, then IDEs; not winget) · Zed

### Dev — terminals & CLI
Windows Terminal · PowerShell 7 · PowerToys · Git · GitHub CLI · delta · Just · Docker Desktop · WSL + Ubuntu 24.04 · Python 3.13 + Launcher · Node.js (native) · restic + resticprofile · **NCALayer** (Kazakh PKI signing — manual, from pki.gov.kz)

### AI / LLM
Claude Desktop · Codex · LM Studio · (WSL: `@openai/codex` via npm)

### Browsers
Google Chrome · Edge (built-in)

### Communication
Slack · AyuGram (your Telegram client) · WhatsApp · Discord · Zoom · RustDesk

### VPN / network
AmneziaVPN + AmneziaWG · Cloudflare WARP

### Media / creation
Shutter Encoder · VLC · AIMP · Spotify · MusicBrainz Picard · Elgato Camera Hub

### Utilities
7-Zip · CrystalDiskInfo · WizTree · NetSpot · Logitech G HUB · NVIDIA App · MyASUS · Intel DSA

### ✂️ Dropped — already excluded from the curated list
These winget IDs are **not** in `winget-packages.json` (kept out on purpose — don't re-add them when folding in a fresh snapshot):
`Warp.Warp` · `SublimeHQ.SublimeText.4` · `Exafunction.Windsurf` · `ZhipuAI.ZCode` · `Google.CloudSDK` · `GitHub.GitHubDesktop` · `Telegram.TelegramDesktop` · `TeamViewer.TeamViewer` · `Proton.ProtonVPN` · `OpenVPNTechnologies.OpenVPNConnect` · `WireGuard.WireGuard` · `OBSProject.OBSStudio` · `CrystalDewWorld.CrystalDiskMark.AoiEdition` · `WinDirStat.WinDirStat` · `Fastfetch-cli.Fastfetch`

Not winget-managed (just don't reinstall): **VS Code** · **Chrome Remote Desktop** · **Supersonic** · **Recuva** · **Tablecruncher**

Notes: Windows `Google.CloudSDK` dropped, but WSL keeps `google-cloud-cli` (gcloud still available in Ubuntu). Terminal = Windows Terminal (Warp gone). VS Code is dropped and no longer used — the script does not export a `vscode-extensions.txt`.

### Cloud storage
OneDrive · Google Drive (re-add accounts; reconcile against SSD copies per Phase 4.6)

### Gaming (re-download, don't back up)
Steam (+ games: Conan Exiles, GTA V, Grounded, Icarus, Metal Hellsinger, NieR Replicant, Portal, Raft, Sons of the Forest, Slay the Princess, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, Wallpaper Engine) · Rockstar Launcher · Xbox
> Save games: mostly Steam Cloud, but check `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games`, `Documents\My Games`, and `AppData` for any local-only saves you care about before wiping.

### WSL (Ubuntu) — rebuild
Captured wholesale in `ubuntu-2404.tar`; for a clean rebuild use `wsl-apt-selections.txt`. Key apt packages: `clang ffmpeg gdal-bin gh google-cloud-cli jq just keychain ncdu npm restic resticprofile` + build libs (`libavif-dev libcairo2-dev libheif-dev libjpeg-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev`). Toolchains: Python 3.12, Node 18, gcloud, gh, codex. **Reinstall `uv`** (Astral — used by every project's venv; not an apt package). npm globals: `@openai/codex`, `vot-cli`.
