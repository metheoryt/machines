# Project memory: machines

Repo-local, git-tracked Claude memory. Loaded every session (merged with
global + per-host memory). One bullet per fact under a topical heading.

## Fleet network

- Boundary: `machines` (this repo) owns NixOS/Windows machine provisioning;
  the sibling `~/my/vps` repo owns the cyphy.kz service platform (Immich,
  Navidrome, Forgejo, RustDesk server, Caddy, the VPS's AmneziaWG hub).
- AmneziaWG VPN hub lives on the VPS (`10.0.0.1/24`); homeserver is the only
  peer today (`10.0.0.2`, static, baked into `vps/vps/setup-awg.sh`).
  `vps/vps/manage-peers.sh` already supports adding arbitrary roaming peers
  (keys stored gitignored in `vps/vps/peers/`, never committed).
- RustDesk is self-hosted on the VPS (hbbs/hbbr, `cyphy.kz`), seeded via
  `modules/home/rustdesk-config.nix` (server key + known-peer IDs, no
  passwords committed).
- No secrets-management framework (sops-nix/agenix) in this repo — the
  existing convention is to keep secrets out of git entirely (fixed
  out-of-store paths provisioned manually once, or gitignored files), not to
  encrypt them in-repo.
- User keeps a separate bare-repo dotfiles tracker at `~/.dotfiles`
  (`git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME`, alias `dotfiles`,
  github.com/metheoryt/dotfiles, private), one branch per machine. Plain
  files, no encryption. Secret files (SSH keys, VPN keys, etc.) are never
  committed but ARE listed in that machine's branch `.gitignore` — the
  ignore entry itself is the "you need to restore/regenerate this on a fresh
  box" checklist, without ever storing the secret content. When adding a new
  per-machine secret (e.g. an AmneziaWG private key), add its path to that
  machine's `.dotfiles` branch `.gitignore` too, not just to this repo.
- SSH keys are per-host, not shared (e.g. latitude5520's is
  `ssh-ed25519 ...  me-nixos-latitude5520`) — each fleet machine has its own
  keypair; cross-machine SSH trust needs each host's *public* key collected
  centrally (see fleet-mesh-vpn-ssh-design.md), not one key copied around.

## Backups

- Fleet restic hub-and-spoke: every client (homeserver's own immich profiles,
  g16's wsl profile) backs up through resticprofile to/on the homeserver
  (REST server on port 8001, or local drives). g16's old `laptop/music`
  profile was retired 2026-07-07 (music no longer lives on g16); see
  `vps` commit `backup: retire g16 laptop music restic profile` and
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-05-machines-fleet-layout-B-backup.md`.
- Homeserver's immich backup targets `G:`/`H:` are 2.5" HDDs in USB docking
  stations plugged into the homeserver — physically removable, but currently
  left permanently attached. Since every backup in the fleet ultimately lands
  on the homeserver (its own immich backups + g16-wsl's REST target), a
  homeserver-location disaster (theft/fire) currently takes out primary data
  and all backups together — not truly offsite yet.
  Why: reviewed 2026-07-07; the fix is cheap because the drives are already
  removable — periodic manual rotation of one dock's drive to an off-site
  location, no new infra needed. Prefer that over recommending cloud/object
  storage additions unless the user wants to skip manual rotation.
- latitude5520 (and g16's native NixOS side) have no dedicated backup today.
  Whatever home-manager declares in this repo is already "backed up" by being
  in git; anything outside home.nix's scope (browser profiles, ad hoc
  `~/.config` dirs, local documents) is not protected. User wants to back up
  latitude5520 into a private repo "someday" (stated 2026-07-07) — not urgent,
  no mechanism chosen yet (chezmoi/stow/plain git all unexplored as of this
  writing).
